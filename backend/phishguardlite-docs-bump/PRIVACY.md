# Privacy

PhishGuard Lite is designed with privacy in mind.

- Link heuristics run **locally in your browser**.
- **No data is sent** to servers unless you click **Report**.
- If you choose to report, the extension sends only:
  - the URL you reported,
  - the page URL you were viewing,
  - the link text,
  - the reasons it looked suspicious,
  - your organization's tenant key.
- Data is transmitted over **HTTPS** to your organization's endpoint and stored **per tenant**.
- Access and retention are determined by your organization's administrators.
