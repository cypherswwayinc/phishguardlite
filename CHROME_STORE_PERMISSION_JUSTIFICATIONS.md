# Chrome Web Store Permission Justifications - PhishGuard Lite

## üîê **Permission Justifications Required by Chrome Web Store**

Chrome Web Store requires developers to justify why specific permissions are needed. Here are the complete justifications for PhishGuard Lite:

---

## üì± **activeTab Permission Justification**

### **Permission Requested:**
```
"activeTab"
```

### **Justification (1000 characters max):**
```
PhishGuard Lite requires activeTab permission to provide real-time phishing detection on websites that users visit. This permission allows the extension to:

1. Access the current tab's content when users explicitly click the extension icon
2. Scan the page for suspicious links and phishing attempts
3. Inject security indicators and risk assessments directly into the webpage
4. Enable one-click reporting of suspicious content

The activeTab permission is essential because:
- Users need to see phishing warnings directly on the pages they're viewing
- Security indicators must be displayed inline with the content for maximum effectiveness
- The extension cannot provide real-time protection without access to page content
- Users expect immediate visual feedback when visiting potentially dangerous sites

This permission is only activated when users explicitly interact with the extension, ensuring privacy and security. Without activeTab, the extension cannot function as intended - users would not see phishing warnings, risk scores, or be able to report suspicious content.

The permission follows Chrome's security best practices by requiring explicit user action before accessing tab content, making it much more secure than broad host permissions.

## üîß **scripting Permission Justification**

### **Permission Requested:**
```
"scripting"
```

### **Justification (1000 characters max):**
```
PhishGuard Lite requires scripting permission to dynamically inject content scripts for enhanced security scanning. This permission enables:

1. Dynamic content script injection when users activate the extension on specific sites
2. On-demand security scanning without running scripts on every page automatically
3. Selective activation based on user interaction and site type
4. Efficient resource usage by only loading security features when needed

The scripting permission is necessary because:
- Content scripts must be injected to scan page content for phishing attempts
- Different websites require different scanning approaches and security measures
- Users need the ability to activate scanning on sites not in the automatic list
- The extension must adapt its security scanning based on the current page context

Without scripting permission, the extension cannot:
- Provide real-time phishing detection on dynamically loaded content
- Adapt security scanning to different website types
- Offer on-demand security activation for user-selected sites
- Maintain efficient performance by avoiding unnecessary script execution

This permission follows Chrome's security model by requiring explicit user action and only injecting scripts when necessary for security scanning functionality.

## üéØ **Alternative Shorter Versions (If Needed)**

### **activeTab - Short Version (500 characters):**
```
PhishGuard Lite needs activeTab to scan webpage content for phishing attempts when users click the extension icon. This allows real-time detection of suspicious links, display of security warnings, and one-click reporting of dangerous content. The permission is only activated on user interaction, ensuring privacy while providing essential security scanning functionality.
```

### **scripting - Short Version (500 characters):**
```
The scripting permission enables dynamic injection of security scanning scripts when users activate the extension. This allows on-demand phishing detection, adaptive scanning for different website types, and efficient resource usage. Without it, the extension cannot provide real-time security scanning or adapt to various page contexts.
```
