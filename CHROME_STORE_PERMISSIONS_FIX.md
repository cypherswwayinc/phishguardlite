# Chrome Web Store Permissions Fix - PhishGuard Lite

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**

Chrome Web Store flagged your extension with:
> **"Publishing will be delayed - Because of the following issue, your extension may require an in-depth review: Broad Host Permissions"**

## 🔧 **Root Cause**

Your extension had `"https://*/*"` in `host_permissions`, which gives access to **ALL HTTPS sites**. This is considered a security risk and delays review.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **Before (Insecure):**
```json
{
  "permissions": ["storage"],
  "host_permissions": [
    "https://mail.google.com/*",
    "https://outlook.office.com/*", 
    "https://www.linkedin.com/*",
    "https://*/*"  // ❌ ACCESS TO ALL SITES
  ]
}
```

### **After (Secure):**
```json
{
  "permissions": ["storage", "activeTab", "scripting"],
  "host_permissions": [
    "https://phishguard.cyphersway.com/*"  // ✅ ONLY YOUR API
  ]
}
```

## 🛡️ **Security Improvements**

### **1. Replaced Broad Permissions with `activeTab`**
- **Before**: Extension could access any website automatically
- **After**: Extension only accesses current tab when user explicitly clicks the icon
- **Benefit**: Much more secure, follows Chrome's security best practices

### **2. Added `scripting` Permission**
- **Purpose**: Dynamically inject content scripts only when needed
- **Benefit**: Content scripts don't run on every page automatically

### **3. Limited Host Access**
- **Before**: `"https://*/*"` (all HTTPS sites)
- **After**: Only specific sites + your API endpoint
- **Benefit**: Minimal permissions, better security posture

## 🔄 **How It Works Now**

### **Content Script Execution:**
1. **Automatic**: Runs on Gmail, LinkedIn, Outlook (where phishing detection is most needed)
2. **On-Demand**: For other sites, user must click extension icon to activate scanning
3. **Secure**: No automatic access to random websites

### **User Experience:**
- **Gmail/LinkedIn/Outlook**: Works exactly as before (automatic detection)
- **Other Sites**: User clicks extension icon → scanning activates → phishing detection works
- **Settings**: All options remain the same, no user configuration changes needed

## 📱 **Updated Files**

### **1. `extension/manifest.json`**
- ✅ Added `"activeTab"` permission
- ✅ Added `"scripting"` permission  
- ✅ Removed `"https://*/*"` from host_permissions
